Oh yay you actually opened the ReadMe! We're so proud of you. (:

Greetings, and welcome to HappyTeams!

-- DECRIPTION --
HappyTeams is a program to assist in organizing students into teams that they will hopefully be most happy in. The students are able to give priorites which are used to guage the possible happiness with those they are paired up with. If the numbers are too low, they're shuffled around and the new groups are tested for their happiness levels. Etc etc!


-- HOW IT WORKS --
The program recieves the student priorities from a txt file.
The user interacts through the command line with: "java -cp target/classes HappyTeams -v # -t # -n # -l # -r # < filename.txt"
* See glossary for key & # == number values of choice *
